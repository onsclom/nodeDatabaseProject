## Use the demo

I am currently hosting the Node.js backend with heroku, the static webpage through github pages with this repo, and the SQL database with ElephantSQL. 

Try the demo [here](https://onsclom.github.io/nodeDatabaseProject/).

## To run server

1. `npm i`
    - this installs necessary packages
2. `node server.js`
    - this runs the server

Then the server is listening at localhost:3000

## To run client

Client is currently hosted with github pages [here](https://onsclom.github.io/nodeDatabaseProject/). Run it locally by using live server on `index.html`.
